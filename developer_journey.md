# Developer Journey

## In Progress 

- We want to understand the steps developers take to create an open-web app so that we can better support them.
- This journey covers the end-to-end process, which is a broader scope than the specific RecRoom project. Developing a common understanding of this journey is good for overall Mozilla + community.
- Developers may not follow these steps in linear order. But we think that most developers engage each of these steps at some point during their process.
- Developers likely loop through Build-Validate-Prepare a few/several times before getting to Launch. [See diagram] [1].
