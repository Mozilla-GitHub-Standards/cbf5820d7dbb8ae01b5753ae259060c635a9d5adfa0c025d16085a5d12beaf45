# What This Project is About

## Goals

- Invest in developers to grow the app ecosystem (business goal)
- Help developers get to solutions more quickly using best practices and recommendations (this teamâ€™s goal)
- Ease into a Mozilla with expertise and POV/opinions (brand goal)
- Provide comprehensive/exhaustive information only for those that need it. **Not as the default.** (design/UX goal)


## Audience
- **Primary audience:** Developers with some existing knowledge who are just getting started with Open Web Apps. These may be web developers or mobile developers. They're not completely new to coding. They need guidance and recommendations to get up-and-running quickly (vs noodling about the MDN).
- **Secondary audience:** Experienced Open Web App developers. These may also be experienced users of MDN. They may benefit from some of our recommendations as "short-cuts" to specific situations they run into.

## Content Scope
We have 3 areas of interest:
- **How to build it:** The high-level "steps" or "process" for building an Open Web App
- **What tools to use:** The tools, libraries, frameworks, etc we recommend for building Open Web Apps. 
- **Best practices for X:** Mozilla recommendations for best practices in specific situations/use cases/scenarios

## Design Considerations
- **How to build it:** This is best represented as list of steps that appears in an early, top-level section in the App Center page architecture. A checklist would be nice here.
- **What tools to use:** RecRoom" supports this scope. It provides one-click install of tools so that developers spend less time thinking (investigating options) and more time doing (coding). RecRoom is best represented as either:
- 1.  An early, top-level section of the App Center
- 2.  A separate site that is linked to from MDN and App Center. Let's discuss! [link here to prototype]
- In either case, RecRoom needs different interaction models than we're currently using in MDN.
- Also a vanity URL would be nice in either case.
- **Best practices for X** - RecRoom also supports this scope. However, RecRoom provides high-level recommendations. It doesn't present an exhaustive explanation for a recommendation. E.g., if we recommend using the camera in X way, we point to deeper, encyclopedic MDN content for those who want more info.

## Feedback + Maintenance Considerations
- How will we solicit and incorporate feedback from the community?
- We want to come up with a plan for maintenance, specifically how to keep the content up-to-date with the changing tool and technology landscape.

## Competitive Landscape

We looked at several "competitors" to see how other tool packages present their materials. Some of these included: Google Dart, Ionic, Android Developer, Windowsphone Developer, Building FirefoxOS, ReadtheDocs, and Brick, as well as frameworks like Rails and Django.

In these sites content is presented as "steps" in a process. This makes it easy for people to build knowledge in incremental ways. There's a lot of use of next/previous - the experiences are guided and, in some cases, directed (some rigidly).
_ The best content is 
- 1. Brief and to the point - It assumes you're there to do work (build stuff) vs "learn" something. Content is presented as bite-sized chunks (vs long pages).
- 2. Imperative - The language tells you what to do. It doesn't include surrounding controversy or history or explanation. It links to deeper reference content for those who are interested.
- 3. Has a POV - Doesn't dance around the fact that it is an opinion. We have a point of view based on our experience. And we're putting it out there because we think other people may find our POV useful.
- 4. Pages are easy to scan - if you're looking for a "tip," you can find it easily because it has the same visual style throughout the site.
- 5. Reference type content is often not displayed by default. E.g., "notes" are displayed on hover, rather than included in the page.

Page have the same internal logic:
- 1. What's in it for me - Why should I care about the content on this page. Often presented as a use-case or scenario. E.g., you should care about X when Y situation occurs.
- 2. Summary of what we'll be doing on this page - we'll cover X, Y, and Z.
- 3. Main content that is chunked in a logical order and includes headers using imperative language, e.g., "Open the file" or "Store user data."
- 4. Concluding content that refers people to deeper content to learn more.
